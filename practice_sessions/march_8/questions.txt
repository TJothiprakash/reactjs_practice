Part 1: Core Concepts (State, Props, Events)
Component Communication (Amazon)

Create a Parent and Child component. Let the Parent hold a counter in state.
When the Child button is clicked, increment the counter in the Parent.

Dynamic List Rendering (Google)

Build a TodoList component that accepts an array of todos as props and displays them.
Add a button to remove a todo item when clicked.

Input Handling (Meta)

Make a controlled LoginForm component with email & password.
Display the live input below the form fields.

Button Toggle (Microsoft)

Build a component with a button that toggles between “Login” and “Logout”.
Show a message like "Welcome back, User" only when logged in.

Props Drilling (Adobe)

Pass a user’s name from Grandparent to Child (3-level deep component tree).
No context allowed — use only props.

⚛️ Part 2: Hooks & Lifecycle
useEffect for API Call (Netflix)

Create a UserList component that fetches users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Use useEffect and display user names in a list.

Custom Hook (Airbnb)

Write a custom hook useWindowWidth that tracks window resize and returns the current width.
Use it in a component to display “Mobile View” if width < 768px.

useRef for Focus (Google)

Make an input form where clicking a “Focus” button puts the cursor into the input.
Use useRef.

Timer with useEffect (Facebook)

Build a countdown timer from 60 seconds that updates every second.
Add a “Reset” button to restart the timer.

Dependency Array Debug (Amazon)

Build a component that increments a counter every time a prop changes, but do not use the prop in the dependency array.
Debug why it doesn't work correctly.

🚀 Part 3: Advanced Practice (Performance, Context, Optimization)
React.memo Demo (Microsoft)

Build a parent with two children — one child depends on state, the other doesn’t.
Use React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Context API (Netflix)

Build a simple theme toggler using React Context.
Clicking a button should switch between Dark and Light mode globally.

Form with Validation (Apple)

Create a form with email & password.
Add validation: email must be valid, password at least 6 characters.
Show error messages live.

useReducer for Complex State (Tesla)

Implement a cart system using useReducer.
Handle ADD_ITEM, REMOVE_ITEM, CLEAR_CART.

Lazy Loading (Meta)

Create a component that lazily loads another component on button click.
Show a loader while it’s loading.

🧩 Part 4: Debugging & Thinking Problems
Bug Fix Challenge

Given a list with keys not defined properly, identify and fix why React warns “Each child should have a unique key”.

Infinite Re-render Debug

A component with useEffect causes infinite re-renders.
What could be the cause? Fix it.

Uncontrolled to Controlled Warning

Given a form where input starts uncontrolled and becomes controlled, fix the warning.

React Key Prop Drill

Write a function that renders a list of items and intentionally use wrong key.
Analyze the impact on performance and DOM.

React StrictMode Behavior (Meta)

Build a component and wrap it with React.StrictMode.
Log the mount and unmount to observe double invocation.
Why is it happening?
